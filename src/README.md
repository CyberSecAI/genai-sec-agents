Security Guide (Stub)
This repository compiles security Rule Cards into agent packages for pre-guidance during code generation and post-validation via CI scanners.

No runtime retrieval. Guidance is embedded into agents at build time.

Traceability via rule IDs and references (ASVS, OWASP topics).

Validation: agents emit expected scanner hooks; CI enforces thresholds.
