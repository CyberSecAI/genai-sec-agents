      "searchable_content": "# V6 Authentication\n\n## Control Objective\n\nAuthentication is the process of establishing or confirming the authenticity of an individual or device. It involves verifying claims made by a person or about a device, ensuring resistance to impersonation, and preventing the recovery or interception of passwords.\n\n[NIST SP 800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) is a modern, evidence-based standard that is valuable for organizations worldwide, but is particularly relevant to US agencies and those interacting with US agencies.\n\nWhile many of the requirements in this chapter are based on the second section of the standard (known as NIST SP 800-63B \"Digital Identity Guidelines - Authentication and Lifecycle Management\"), the chapter focuses on common threats and frequently exploited authentication weaknesses. It does not attempt to comprehensively cover every point in the standard. For cases where full NIST SP 800-63 compliance is necessary, please refer to NIST SP 800-63.\n\nAdditionally, NIST SP 800-63 terminology may sometimes differ, and this chapter often uses more commonly understood terminology to improve clarity.\n\nA common feature of more advanced applications is the ability to adapt authentication stages required based on various risk factors. This feature is covered in the \"Authorization\" chapter, since these mechanisms also need to be considered for authorization decisions.\n\n## V6.1 Authentication Documentation\n\nThis section contains requirements detailing the authentication documentation that should be maintained for an application. This is crucial for implementing and assessing how the relevant authentication controls should be configured.\n\n| # | Description | Level |\n| :---: | :--- | :---: |\n| **6.1.1** | Verify that application documentation defines how controls such as rate limiting, anti-automation, and adaptive response, are used to defend against attacks such as credential stuffing and password brute force. The documentation must make clear how these controls are configured and prevent malicious account lockout. | 1 |\n| **6.1.2** | Verify that a list of context-specific words is documented in order to prevent their use in passwords. The list could include permutations of organization names, product names, system identifiers, project codenames, department or role names, and similar. | 2 |\n| **6.1.3** | Verify that, if the application includes multiple authentication pathways, these are all documented together with the security controls and authentication strength which must be consistently enforced across them. | 2 |\n\n## V6.2 Password Security\n\nPasswords, called \"Memorized Secrets\" by NIST SP 800-63, include passwords, passphrases, PINs, unlock patterns, and picking the correct kitten or another image element. They are generally considered \"something you know\" and are often used as a single-factor authentication mechanism.\n\nAs such, this section contains requirements for making sure that passwords are created and handled securely. Most of the requirements are L1 as they are most important at that level. From L2 onwards, multi-factor authentication mechanisms are required, where passwords may be one of those factors.\n\nThe requirements in this section mostly relate to [&sect; 5.1.1.2](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecretver) of [NIST's Guidance](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html).\n\n| # | Description | Level |\n| :---: | :--- | :---: |\n| **6.2.1** | Verify that user set passwords are at least 8 characters in length although a minimum of 15 characters is strongly recommended. | 1 |\n| **6.2.2** | Verify that users can change their password. | 1 |\n| **6.2.3** | Verify that password change functionality requires the user's current and new password. | 1 |\n| **6.2.4** | Verify that passwords submitted during account registration or password change are checked against an available set of, at least, the top 3000 passwords which match the application's password policy, e.g. minimum length. | 1 |\n| **6.2.5** | Verify that passwords of any composition can be used, without rules limiting the type of characters permitted. There must be no requirement for a minimum number of upper or lower case characters, numbers, or special characters. | 1 |\n| **6.2.6** | Verify that password input fields use type=password to mask the entry. Applications may allow the user to temporarily view the entire masked password, or the last typed character of the password. | 1 |\n| **6.2.7** | Verify that \"paste\" functionality, browser password helpers, and external password managers are permitted. | 1 |\n| **6.2.8** | Verify that the application verifies the user's password exactly as received from the user, without any modifications such as truncation or case transformation. | 1 |\n| **6.2.9** | Verify that passwords of at least 64 characters are permitted. | 2 |\n| **6.2.10** | Verify that a user's password stays valid until it is discovered to be compromised or the user rotates it.
