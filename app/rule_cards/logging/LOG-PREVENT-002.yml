title: Implement secure transmission protocols for log data
severity: low
scope: web-application
requirement: Use secure transmission protocols when sending log data over untrusted
  networks to prevent interception or tampering of log entries during transit.
do:
- Utilize secure transmission protocols (e.g., TLS) for transmitting log data over
  untrusted networks
- Encrypt log data before transmission to protect confidentiality and integrity
dont:
- Do not transmit log data over untrusted networks without encryption
detect:
  semgrep:
  - logging.secure-transmission
  trufflehog:
  - Sensitive Data Exposure
verify:
  tests:
  - Verify that log data is transmitted using secure protocols
  - Test the encryption of log data during transmission for effectiveness
