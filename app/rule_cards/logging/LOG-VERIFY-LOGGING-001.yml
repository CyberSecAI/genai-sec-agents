title: Perform regular testing and verification of logging mechanisms
severity: low
scope: web-application
requirement: Regularly test and verify the functionality of logging mechanisms to
  ensure they are operational, accurate, and effective in capturing security-relevant
  events.
do:
- Include logging mechanisms in code review and application testing processes
- Verify that logs are being generated as expected during security verification
- Test the resilience of logging mechanisms against common attacks and failures
dont:
- Do not assume logging mechanisms are functioning correctly without regular testing
detect:
  semgrep:
  - logging.testing-verification
  trufflehog:
  - Sensitive Data Exposure
verify:
  tests:
  - Conduct regular testing of logging mechanisms to ensure proper functionality
  - Verify that logs are accurate and complete during security assessments
