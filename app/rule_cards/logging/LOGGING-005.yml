title: Encrypt log data in transit and at rest
severity: high
scope: web-application
requirement: Encrypt log data both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information
  from unauthorized access or interception.
do:
- Use secure transmission protocols for sending log data over untrusted networks
- Encrypt log data stored at rest using strong encryption algorithms
- Consider data masking or encryption for sensitive log entries
dont:
- Do not transmit log data over untrusted networks without encryption
detect:
  semgrep:
  - logging.encryption-transit
  - logging.encryption-rest
  trufflehog:
  - Sensitive Data Exposure
verify:
  tests:
  - Verify that log data is encrypted in transit and at rest
  - Test encryption mechanisms during security testing to ensure effectiveness
