title: Synchronize time across all servers and devices for accurate logging
severity: low
scope: web-application
requirement: Ensure time synchronization across all servers and devices to maintain
  accurate timestamps in log entries, facilitating correlation and analysis of events
  across the application environment.
do:
- Implement time synchronization mechanisms for all servers and devices
- Use network time protocols (NTP) to ensure consistent time across the infrastructure
- Regularly monitor and adjust time settings to prevent drift
dont:
- Do not overlook time synchronization, leading to inaccurate event timestamps
detect:
  semgrep:
  - logging.time-synchronization
  trufflehog:
  - Data Integrity
verify:
  tests:
  - Verify that time synchronization is in place for all servers and devices
  - Test the accuracy of event timestamps in log entries
