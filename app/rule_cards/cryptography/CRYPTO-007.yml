title: Minimum Security Strength for Cryptographic Primitives
severity: medium
scope: web-application/api/mobile/infrastructure

  of security based on the algorithm, key size, and configuration
do:
- Verify that cryptographic primitives provide a minimum of 128-bits of security
dont:
- Use cryptographic primitives with insufficient security strength
