title: Application Key Protection and Management
severity: high
scope: web-application
requirement: Application encryption keys should be properly protected, not exposed
  in client-side code or public ...
do:
- Implement approved key derivation functions with key stretching parameters when
  deriving secret keys from passwords
- Use cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNG) with at least
  128 bits of entropy for generating non-guessable random numbers and strings
- Use approved cryptographic algorithms and modes of operation for key generation,
  seeding, digital signature generation, and verification
- Implement full memory encryption to protect sensitive data while in use
- Minimize data exposure during processing and encrypt data immediately after use
  or as soon as feasible
dont:
- Expose application encryption keys in client-side code or public repositories
