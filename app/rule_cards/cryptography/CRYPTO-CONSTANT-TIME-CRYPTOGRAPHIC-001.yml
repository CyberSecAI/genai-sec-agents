title: Constant-Time Cryptographic Operations
severity: high
scope: web-application/api/mobile/infrastructure
requirement: Ensure all cryptographic operations are constant-time to avoid information
  leakage
do:
- Implement cryptographic operations that are constant-time with no 'short-circuit'
  operations
dont:
- Allow timing side-channel attacks by not implementing constant-time operations
detect:

  - crypto.weak-crypto
verify:
  tests:
  - Verify implementation meets security requirements
