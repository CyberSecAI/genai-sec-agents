title: Rate Limit Push Notifications for Multi-Factor Authentication
severity: high
scope: web-application
requirement: Verify that rate limiting is applied to push notifications used for multi-factor
  authentication to prevent push bombing attacks. Number matching may also
  mitigate this risk by requiring user interaction.
do:
- Implement rate limiting for push notifications in multi-factor authentication
- Consider implementing number matching as an additional mitigation strategy
- Monitor and log excessive push notification attempts
dont:
- Do not allow unlimited push notifications without rate limiting
- Do not rely solely on push notifications without additional controls
- Avoid implementing push notifications without abuse prevention mechanisms

  - javascript.express.security.audit.express-session-no-secret
  - python.django.security.audit.session-cookie-secure-false
  - generic.secrets.security.hardcoded-secret
verify:
  tests:
  - Test rate limiting functionality for push notifications
  - Verify number matching implementation if used
  - Test push bombing attack scenarios
