title: Validate Digital Signatures on Authentication Assertions
severity: high
scope: web-application
requirement: Verify that the presence and integrity of digital signatures on authentication
  assertions are always validated, rejecting any assertions that are unsigned or have
  invalid signatures.
do:
- Always validate digital signatures on authentication assertions for presence and integrity
- Reject any assertions that are unsigned or have invalid signatures
- Implement proper cryptographic verification of signature algorithms
dont:
- Do not accept authentication assertions without validating digital signatures
- Do not rely on client-side signature validation alone
- Avoid accepting assertions with weak or deprecated signature algorithms
detect:
  semgrep:
  - javascript.express.security.audit.express-session-no-secret
  - python.django.security.audit.session-cookie-secure-false
  - generic.secrets.security.hardcoded-secret
verify:
  tests:
  - Test validation of digital signatures on authentication assertions
  - Verify rejection of unsigned assertions
  - Test handling of invalid signature scenarios
