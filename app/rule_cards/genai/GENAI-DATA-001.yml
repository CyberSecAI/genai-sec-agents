title: "GenAI applications must protect sensitive data from exposure through model outputs"
severity: critical
scope: genai-applications
requirement: "Generative AI applications must implement data loss prevention controls to prevent sensitive information, personal data, or confidential business information from being exposed through model responses or training data."
do:
  - "Implement data classification and labeling for sensitive information"
  - "Use data sanitization and redaction before processing with GenAI models"
  - "Apply output filtering to detect and block sensitive data in responses"
  - "Implement access controls and data governance for GenAI training data"
  - "Use differential privacy techniques where appropriate for model training"
  - "Monitor and audit GenAI outputs for data leakage incidents"
dont:
  - "Do not include sensitive data in GenAI training datasets without protection"
  - "Do not process personal information without proper consent and controls"
  - "Do not ignore data classification when designing GenAI workflows"
  - "Do not allow unrestricted access to GenAI models with sensitive training data"
  - "Do not skip output validation that could expose confidential information"
  - "Do not store or log sensitive data processed by GenAI systems"

  tests:
    - "Verify sensitive data is detected and redacted before GenAI processing"
    - "Test that PII and confidential data do not appear in model outputs"
    - "Confirm data access controls prevent unauthorized GenAI model usage"
    - "Validate output filtering blocks sensitive information leakage"
    - "Test data governance policies are enforced in GenAI workflows"
