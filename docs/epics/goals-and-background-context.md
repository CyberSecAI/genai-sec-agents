# **Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**

The primary goals of this project are to:

* Significantly reduce the time and cost associated with remediating common security vulnerabilities.  
* Improve developer velocity by preventing security issues from blocking the CI/CD pipeline late in the development cycle.  
* Establish a consistent, auditable, and scalable security posture by codifying internal and external security standards.  
* Increase developer trust and satisfaction with the security process by providing guidance that is immediate, actionable, and consistent.

## **Background Context**

The organization's current security workflow creates significant friction for our development teams. Security feedback is often delivered late by CI/CD scanners, forcing expensive context-switching and delaying releases. This creates a perception of security as a blocker rather than a partner.

This project addresses this by creating an AI-powered assistant that shifts security guidance to the very beginning of the development process—right in the developer's IDE. By leveraging a hybrid knowledge base of both industry standards (OWASP) and our own internal security lessons, the system will provide immediate, consistent, and actionable advice. This allows us to prevent vulnerabilities before they are written, scale the expertise of our AppSec team, and ensure that our security policies are enforced consistently from the first line of code to the final build.
