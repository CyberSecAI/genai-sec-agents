👉 Suggestion: build a **curation matrix** where each row = rule candidate, with columns:

* Source (CheatSheet, Semgrep, ASVS, CIS, etc.)
* Rule ID
* Detect hook availability (yes/no)
* License (CC-BY-SA, Apache 2, proprietary)
* Status (adopt, custom check needed)

That way, your compiler can selectively pull rules only from license-safe, machine-actionable sources.
