great, for mitre cwe I want the CWEs and domains listed in these https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/unforgivable_vulns/unforgivable.pdf https://cwe.mitre.org/documents/sources/SevenPerniciousKingdoms.pdf And I think they should be organized by this view https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1008.html




Perfect—so you’d like to enrich your rule cards by mapping them to relevant **MITRE CWE entries**, but scoped to the **Unforgivable Vulnerabilities** and **Seven Pernicious Kingdoms** sets and organized using the **architecture concepts view (CWE‑1008)**.

Here’s a structured way to do that:

---

## 1. Extracting CWE lists from the two key sources

* **Unforgivable Vulnerabilities** — the original list (circa 2007) includes items such as:

  * Hard-coded passwords/credentials (e.g., CWE‑259)
  * Known insecure crypto algorithms (CWE‑327, CWE‑61)
  * Integer overflows (CWE‑190), others ([Common Weakness Enumeration][1], [Common Weakness Enumeration][2])

* **Seven Pernicious Kingdoms (7PK)** taxonomy is captured in CWE View **700**, with branches like **Security Features (254)**, **Input Validation (1005)**, etc., each pointing to specific CWEs (e.g., Improper Input Validation — CWE‑20; Use of Hard‑coded Password — CWE‑259) ([Common Weakness Enumeration][3])

---

## 2. Organizing by CWE Architecture View (CWE-1008)

This view acts as a high-level taxonomy (architecture-level), helping you group weaknesses under conceptual domains. Good news: CWEs from your sources can map into this view, enabling structured overlays over your rule card topics (e.g., authentication, secrets, etc.).

---

## 3. Matching your existing rule card categories to CWE domains

You already have rule cards for:

* authentication
* authorization
* cookies
* cryptography
* data\_protection
* docker
* genai
* jwt
* network\_security
* owasp (general)
* secrets
* session\_management

Let’s map a few, as concrete examples:

* **authentication / authorization**
  → 7PK Security Features → Pillar: Improper Access Control (CWE‑284) → Class: Improper Authorization (CWE‑285) → Base: Missing Authorization (CWE‑862), Authentication Missing (CWE‑306) ([Common Weakness Enumeration][3])

* **secrets (hard-coded credentials)**
  → 7PK Security Features → Use of Hard‑coded Password (CWE‑259) / Use of Hard‑coded Credentials (CWE‑798) ([Common Weakness Enumeration][3])

* **input validation / SQL injection (data\_protection)**
  → 7PK Input Validation → Improper Input Validation (CWE‑20); SQLi: CWE‑89 ([Common Weakness Enumeration][3], [Common Weakness Enumeration][4])

* **session\_management / cookies**
  → 7PK Time and State → Session Fixation (CWE‑384) ([Common Weakness Enumeration][3])

* **cryptography**
  → 7PK Security Features → Use of Insufficiently Random Values (CWE‑330) ([Common Weakness Enumeration][3])

## 4. Next steps: Build your mapping table (e.g., research/controls.xlsx)

Here's a starting template with examples:

| Rule Card Topic    | CWE ID  | CWE Title                           | 7PK Category / View                    | Architecture Concept (CWE-1008)  |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Secrets            | CWE-259 | Hard-coded password                 | 7PK Security Features → Password       | Trust Boundary / Data Protection |
| Authentication     | CWE-306 | Missing Authentication              | 7PK Security Features → Access Control | Access Control                   |
| Authorization      | CWE-285 | Improper Authorization              | 7PK Security Features → Access Control | Access Control                   |
| Input Validation   | CWE-20  | Improper Input Validation           | 7PK Input Validation & Representation  | Input Handling                   |
| SQL Injection      | CWE-89  | SQL Injection                       | 7PK Input Validation                   | Input Handling                   |
| Session Management | CWE-384 | Session Fixation                    | 7PK Time & State                       | Session Integrity                |
| Cryptography       | CWE-330 | Use of Insufficiently Random Values | 7PK Security Features → Crypto         | Cryptographic Integrity          |

You can continue to align your other rule card categories like `cookies`, `network_security`, `docker`, `genai`, etc., mapping each to CWEs under appropriate 7PK branches and architecture concepts.

---

## Summary

* You're anchoring your rule cards to authoritative CWEs within **Unforgivable Vulnerabilities** and **Seven Pernicious Kingdoms**, categorized under the **architecture concept view (CWE-1008)**.
* The mapping structure strengthens your auditability and traceability—from high-level rule topics → CWE taxonomy → domain concept.
* Once mapped out, you can embed these CWEs into your rule cards under `refs.cwe`, augmenting them with domain context and enabling richer CI dashboards or scoring.
