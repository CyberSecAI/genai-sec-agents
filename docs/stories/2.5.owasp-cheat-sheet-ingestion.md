# **Story 2.5: OWASP Cheat Sheet Ingestion**

**Epic:** IDE Agent Integration (Claude Code MVP)

## **User Story**

* **As a** Security-Focused Architect (Leo),
* **I want** the system to automatically ingest and normalize security guidance from OWASP Cheat Sheets into Rule Cards,
* **so that** developers receive comprehensive, industry-standard security guidance without manual rule card creation overhead.

## **Context and Dependencies**

This story implements **FR2: Hybrid Knowledge Ingestion** from the PRD, specifically the external sources component. It builds upon the semantic search infrastructure from Story 2.4 to provide a dramatically expanded knowledge base.

**Current State:**
- 15 manually created Rule Cards across 5 security domains
- Local semantic search with limited corpus (Story 2.4)
- Manual rule card creation process

**Target State:**
- 100+ Rule Cards automatically generated from OWASP Cheat Sheets
- Comprehensive coverage of 20+ security domains
- Automated ingestion pipeline with version tracking
- Enhanced semantic search corpus with industry-standard guidance

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ **Story 2.1**: Agentic Runtime Core (provides agent package compilation)
- ✅ **Story 2.2**: Claude Code Sub-Agent (provides real-time guidance delivery)  
- ✅ **Story 2.3**: Manual On-Demand Execution (provides manual analysis commands)
- ✅ **Story 2.4**: Semtools Semantic Search (provides corpus management infrastructure)

## **Acceptance Criteria**

### **Task 1: OWASP Content Acquisition and Parsing**
1. Script fetches OWASP Cheat Sheet markdown directly from GitHub repository (e.g., https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/JSON_Web_Token_for_Java_Cheat_Sheet.md)
2. Raw markdown content is acquired from raw.githubusercontent.com for secure, direct access
3. Content versioning tracks OWASP updates and changes over time via Git commit hashes
4. Parsing extracts markdown structure for LLM processing without complex format handling

### **Task 2: Content Normalization and Rule Card Generation**
1. ChatGPT processes OWASP markdown content with structured prompts and example Rule Card templates
2. Generated Rule Cards follow the established schema (id, title, severity, scope, requirement, do, dont, detect, verify, refs)
3. LLM-based approach extracts actionable security requirements from natural language content
4. Multiple Rule Cards can be generated from a single comprehensive cheat sheet using intelligent content segmentation

### **Task 3: Scanner Integration Mapping**
1. Generated Rule Cards include appropriate scanner configurations (Semgrep, TruffleHog, CodeQL)
2. OWASP guidance is mapped to existing scanner rule databases
3. Custom detection patterns are created when no existing scanner rules exist
4. Scanner integration maintains consistency with manually created Rule Cards

### **Task 4: Corpus Integration and Semantic Enhancement**
1. Generated Rule Cards are automatically integrated into the semantic search corpus
2. OWASP-sourced content is clearly identified with provenance tracking
3. Semantic search can differentiate between internal and OWASP-sourced guidance
4. Corpus size remains manageable (<500MB) with intelligent content selection

### **Task 5: Ingestion Pipeline and Automation**
1. Automated ingestion pipeline can be triggered manually or on schedule
2. Pipeline validates generated Rule Cards against schema requirements
3. Duplicate detection prevents redundant Rule Cards from multiple sources
4. Change detection identifies when OWASP content has been updated

### **Task 6: Quality Assurance and Validation**
1. Generated Rule Cards pass the same validation as manually created cards
2. Content quality metrics ensure actionable, accurate guidance
3. Generated Rule Cards integrate seamlessly with existing agent packages
4. Performance impact of expanded corpus remains within acceptable limits (<2s response time)

## **Security Requirements**

1. **Content Integrity**: OWASP content is validated for tampering during ingestion
2. **Source Verification**: Only official OWASP sources are permitted for ingestion  
3. **Sanitization**: All ingested content is sanitized to prevent injection attacks
4. **Access Control**: Ingestion pipeline requires appropriate authorization
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all ingestion activities and content changes

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **NFR1 (Performance)**: Rule Card generation completes within 10 minutes for full OWASP corpus
2. **NFR2 (Quality)**: Generated Rule Cards maintain 90%+ accuracy compared to manual review
3. **NFR3 (Coverage)**: Ingestion captures 80%+ of actionable security guidance from each cheat sheet
4. **NFR4 (Compatibility)**: Generated Rule Cards maintain full compatibility with existing Stories 2.1-2.4
